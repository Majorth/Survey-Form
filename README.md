# Survey-Form
HTML CSS survey Form for fCC
Develop and publish a Survey form, using HTML and CSS only.
I will write a short survey about shopping bag usage: disposable or reusable. 
HTML was straightforward.
I need to work on the margins and padding usage. Playing around with it did help this time. More time will useful.  I need to focus on layout, centering and shifting items around more on the next projects.
